# Data Plotting Application

## Overview

This Data Plotting Application is a Django-based web tool designed to generate dynamic plots from user-provided datasets. It simplifies the visualization process and offers a user-friendly interface to create various types of charts and graphs.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface for data input.
- Dynamic generation of plots and charts based on input data.
- Support for multiple plot types (e.g., line, bar, scatter, etc.).
- Downloadable images of the generated plots.

## Notes

Currently, this project is only a frontend demo and the integration with the backend is not yet complete. The plan is for the backend to handle database communication and image generation, then send these to the frontend for rendering. The necessary interfaces have been reserved for this purpose.
